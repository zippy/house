### Making things visible
1. Use [Issues](https://github.com/zippy/house/issues) for repeating or small tasks that need to be tracked.
2. Use [Projects](https://github.com/zippy/house/projects) for big tasks that need to be organized an could use a KanBan

### Patterns

1. Use this tool as little as possible, but no less.
   1. Don't use any of these tools until there's a task or project that needs it!
1. Use labels on issues to categorize
1. Use pull requests on a branch to modify this Readme
1. Start with stickies on the column by the kitchen if you are in the house!

### Grammars
